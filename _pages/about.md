I am a master student at Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking University, advised by [Prof. Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home). 

I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Intergrated Science Program from Yuanpei College, Peking University. During my undergraduate study, I worked with [Prof. Chao Tang](http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/tanglab/index.htm) at Quantitive Center of Biology. I worked on metabolic flux analysis of cyanobacteria and growth behavior of fisson yeast and budding yeast.


My research interests include automatic fact checking, table reasoning and adversarial attacks. I am also interested in the intersection of machine learning and biology.
